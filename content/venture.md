With my [professional experience](https://dhruvikdonga.github.io/work) across domains, building systems and collaborating with like-minded people, I’ve been driven to pursue ideas that can scale into meaningful products.

To me, a venture sits at the intersection of:
- A real problem
- The skillset to solve it
- A team to scale it
- A revenue model to sustain it
