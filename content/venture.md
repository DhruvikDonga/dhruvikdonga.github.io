With my [professional experience](https://dhruvikdonga.github.io/work) across domains, building systems and collaborating with like-minded people, I’ve been driven to pursue ideas that can scale into meaningful products.

> To me, a venture sits at the intersection of:
> - A real problem
> - The skillset to solve it
> - A team to scale it
> - A revenue model to sustain it
