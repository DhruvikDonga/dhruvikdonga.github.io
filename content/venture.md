# Venture

With my [professional experience](https://dhruvikdonga.github.io/work) across domains,building systems and collaborating with like-minded people, I’ve been driven to pursue ideas that can scale into meaningful products.

To me, a venture sits at the intersection of:
- A real problem
- The skillset to solve it
- A team to scale it
- A revenue model to sustain it


## AutomateTG 
    *Dec 2025 - Present*
    **Co founder**
    [AutomateTG](https://automatetg.com) is a SaaS platform that provides advanced Telegram automation powered by Telegram’s open-source MTProto protocol — the layer between Telegram’s backend and its mobile clients.

    The product solves limitations of traditional bots, such as the inability to monitor channels or groups where users are not admins, by enabling user-level session automation.

    **My Role**
    - Building and scaling the core platform, including Telegram session handling, MTProto integrations, and high-concurrency job scheduling.
    - Developing message rule–based monitoring, scheduled AI summaries, and secure job execution pipelines.
    - Designing and implementing advanced data encryption for stored user job data.
    - Maintaining and scaling infrastructure with strong focus on cost efficiency and reliability.
    - Driving product roadmap and business development.

    **Tech: Go, React.js, Supabase, Kamal CI/CD, MongoDB**
