As the pages of 2023 turn, let's go through a series of events—coding escapades, sun-soaked beaches, and the quiet battles fought behind the scenes. Inspired by the wrap-ups from Spotify, YouTube Music, Reddit, and more, let's delve into the major events that shaped 2023.

## **1. [Miniwordgames.com](http://miniwordgames.com) Launch: 🚀**
Embarking on a coding journey, the dilemma of "what to build" led to the birth of **miniwordgames.com**. This multiplayer web game, fueled by **Golang, Vue.js, Docker, and AWS**, made waves on Reddit with **50+ upvotes and 20 GitHub stars**.
