# **2023 Wrap Up: A Journey of Code, Beaches, and Resilience 🚀🏖️**

As the pages of 2023 turn, let's go through a series of events—coding escapades, sun-soaked beaches, and the quiet battles fought behind the scenes. Inspired by the wrap-ups from Spotify, YouTube Music, Reddit, and more, let's delve into the major events that shaped 2023.

## **1. [Miniwordgames.com](http://miniwordgames.com) Launch: 🚀**
Embarking on a coding journey, the dilemma of "what to build" led to the birth of **miniwordgames.com**. This multiplayer web game, fueled by **Golang, Vue.js, Docker, and AWS**, made waves on Reddit with **50+ upvotes and 20 GitHub stars**. Beyond the code, a sleek websockets wrapper enhanced the streaming experience, marking a tech triumph.

Mid-year, the keyboard took a back seat as I embraced the sun-soaked shores of **Goa**. From beach bumming to wild parties, every box on the quintessential Goa checklist was ticked. A vacation of firsts and lasts, leaving behind a treasure trove of memories.
